Baseline
========

Our first measurement will establish a starting point for our performance tweaking. There are two metrics we will be tracking during the workbook â€“ throughput for Vector based maps and Raster based maps. Reminder that throughput is the number of Maps your server can produce per second.

Vector Data
-----------

.. admonition:: Exercise
   
   #. The world wide natural earth dataset is very small and has already been optimized for quick visualisations.
      
      To get a more realistic setup we are going to make use of the of the `Roads <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/roads/>`__ "North America supplement" which we have setup as a PostGIS table.
   
   #. Login to GeoServer administration using credentials ``admin/geoserver``.
   
   #. Navigate to :menuselection:`Data --> Import Data`.
   
   #. For :guilabel:`Choose a data source to import from` check :guilabel:`PostGIS`.
      
      .. figure:: img/import-postgis.png
         
         Data source selection
         
   #. Fill in the appropriate configuration details.
      
      * Database: workshop
      * Username: postgres
      * Password: postgres
      
      .. figure:: img/import-configure.png
         
         PostGIS connection parameters
         
      .. only:: instructor
       
         .. note::  The default database and username is determined from the current user. When running asa a service the temporaryly generated name is not useful.
         
   #. Create a new data store in the ``ne`` workspace.
      
      * Workspace: ``ne``
      * Store: ``Create new``
      
      .. figure:: img/import-target.png
         
         Create new target store
   
   #. Click :guilabel:`Next` to start the import process.
      
   #. GeoServer will connect to the database and list the available spatial tables.
   
      Checkmark the ``roads`` layer, and click :guilabel:`Import`.
   
   #. The store is added to GeoServer, and a new layer configured (along with a default style).
      
      .. figure:: img/import-success.png
          
         Import Success
         
   #. You can directly :guilabel:`View in Layer Preview` to see the resulting layer.
      
      .. figure:: img/import-preview.png
         
         Layer Preview showing Vector Network Use
      
   #. Since there was already a ``roads`` layer, the new layer has been created as ``roads0``.
      
      Navigate to :menuselectio:``Data --> Layers`` rename the layer to:
      
      * Name: ``roads_na``
      * Title: ``Roads North America``
      
      .. figure:: img/import-roads_na.png
         
         Rename to ``hyp``

Raster Data
-----------

.. admonition:: Exercise
   
   #. It is a real challenge to find raster data that is large enough to work with constructively for a workbook like this one.
      
      To get a larger sample we are going `Cross Blend Hypso with Relief, Water, Drains and Ocean Bottom <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cross-blend-hypso/cross-blended-hypso-with-relief-water-drains-and-ocean-bottom/>`__ downloading the "Large size".
   
   #. Unzip the file into your :file:`GEOSERVER_DATA_DIRECTORY` folder :file:`raster/ne1`.
      
      .. note:: You can double check the location of your data directory under :guilabel:`Server Status`.
   
      The file should be around 667 MB in size.

   #. Navigate to :menuselection:`Data --> Import Data`.
   
   #. For :guilabel:`Choose a data source to import from` check :guilabel:`Spatial Files`.
   
   #. For configuration details click :guilabel:`Browse` and navigate to:
      
      * Choose a file or directory: ``raster\hyp\HYP_HR_SR_OB_DR.tif``
   
   #. Create a new data store in the ``ne`` workspace.
      
      * Workspace: ``ne``
      * Store: ``Create new``
   
   #. Click :guilabel:`Next` to start the import process.
   
   #. From the resulting table checkmark ``HYP_HR_SR_OB_DR`` and click :guilabel:`Import`
      
      .. figure:: img/import-raster.png
         
         Import HYP_HR_SR_OB_DR GeoTIFF
   
   #. Even with this larger file raster performance is impressively quick.
      
      .. figure:: img/import-preview2.png
         
         Layer Preview showing Raster Network Use

   #. Navigate to :menuselectio:``Data --> Layers`` rename the layer to:
      
      * Name: ``hyp``
      * Title: ``Hypsometric``
      
      .. figure:: img/import-hyp.png
         
         Rename to ``hyp``
      
      This will make things easier as we will refer to this layer often.

JMeter
------

.. admonition:: Exercise

   #. JMeter is a Java application, and will require Java to run:
   
      * On Linux Java has already been installed as a dependency.
   
      * On windows and mac you may need to download and install Java: https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
   
        OpenGeo Suite included an embedded Java Runtime for the Jetty application server to use, but did not install one for system wide use.
   
   #. Download JMeter from the Apache Foundation:
   
      * http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi

   #. Unzip the JMeter download (say to your desktop).

   #. To run JMeter, navigate into the :file:`bin` folder and run :command:`jmeter.bat` or :command:`jmeter.sh` as appropriate.
   
      .. figure:: img/jmeter.png
      
         Apache JMeter

.. admonition:: Explore
   
   Check out the :file:`scripts` directory for a series of CSV files we will be using to simulate GetMap requests:
   
   * raster-bbox.csv
   * vector-bbox.csv
   * roads-bbox.csv
   
   The python script :file:`wms_request.py`` used to generate these files is included. This script was developed for the "FOSS4G 2009 WMS Shootout".

.. admonition:: Exercise

   We can now define our first benchmark:
   
   #. JMeter is used to define and execute test plans, recoding metrics for performance analysis.
      
      .. figure:: img/jm-test-plans.png
         
         Test Plans
         
      The main JMeter application shows the components that make up a test plan on the left, and the test plan details on the right.
      
   #. We are going to want our raster and vector tests independently (rather than all at once).
   
      Check :guilabel:Run Thread Groups consecutively
   
   #. Right click on :guilabel:`Test Plan` and select :menuselection:`Add --> Threads (Users) --> Thread Group` , and then fill in the following details.
      
      * Name: Vector Test
      * Number of Threads: 20
      * Ramp-Up Period: 0
      * Loop Count: 1
      
      .. figure:: img/jm-vector-tests.png
          
          Vector Tests
          
      .. note::
         
         Take this opportunity to :guilabel:`Save`, and remember to save as you go.
         
   #. Right click :guilabel:`Vector Test` and select :menuselection:`Add --> Logic Controller --> Loop Controller`, and fill in the following:
      
      * Name: Loop Controller
      * Loop Count: 5
      
      This is set to run 20 threads against this test once (the ``Thread Group``), each thread will loop 5 times (the ``Loop Controller``) totally 100 requests for the test plan.
      
      .. note:: 
         
         As an alternative we could of set the :guilabel:`Loop Coun` in the ``Thread Controller`` - this just gave us a chance to introduce how a logic controller can be used when setting up a test plan.
    
   #. Right click :guilabel:`Loop Controller` and select :menuselection:`Add --> Config Element -->User Defined Variables`, and fill in the following:
      
      * Name: Vector Parameters
      
      And use :guilabel:`Add` to fill in three parameters:
      
      * vformat: ``image/png``
      * vstyles: 
      * vlayers: ``ne:roads_na``
      
      .. figure:: img/jm-vector-params.png
         
         User Defined Variables vformat, vstyles, vlayers
    
   #. Next :menuselection:`Add --> Sampler --> HTTP Request`, fill in:
      
      * Name: Vector Requests
      * Server Name: localhost
      * Port Number: 8080
      
      .. figure:: img/jm-vector-requests1.png
         
         HTTP Request Web Server
      
      .. note:: This *Sampler* forms the heart of our test plan, issuing requests to the server.
   
   #. Fill in :guilabel:`HTTP Request` details.
      
      * Implementation: Java
      * Method: GET
      * Path: ``geoserver/wms``
      * Redirect automatically: checked
      * Use KeepAlive: checked
      
      And set up the request parameters required for WMS GetMap:
      
      * service: ``WMS``
      * version: ``1.1.0``
      * request: ``GetMap``
      * layers: ``${vlayers}``
      * styles: ``${vstyles}``
      * format: ``${vformat}``
      * bbox: ``${vleft},${vbottom},${vright},{$vtop}``
      * srs: ``${srs}``
      * width: ``${width}``
      * height: ``${height}``
      * ``${extraParams}}``
      
      .. note:: the values for the parameters bbox, styles and so on in the HTTP request above are set ``${vleft}`` and so on. These are *test properties* set from other portions of the JMeter test plan. These come from fixed sources (*User Defined Variables*) and dynamic sources (*CSV Data Set Config*).
     
      .. figure:: img/jm-vector-requests2.png   
         
         HTTP Request Query
  
   #. Next :menuselection:`Add --> Config Element --> CSV Data Set Config` to refer to the `roads-bbox.csv`.
      
      * Name: ``CSV Roads BBox``
      * Filename: (fill in the path to :file:`roads-bbox.csv`)
      * Variable Names: width,height,vleft,vbottom,vright,vtop
      * Delimiter: ``,``
     
      .. figure:: img/jm-roads-csv.png
        
         CSV Data Set Config roads-bbox.csv
     
      .. note:: The CSV Data Set Config items load parameters from a CSV file. In this case the raster and vector tests load bounding box parameters from a list to ensure that re-running the tests will request the same set of random bounding boxes. 
   
   #. We have not quite defined all our *test properties* yet, many ``GetMap`` parameters will be common to both our raster and our vector tests.
   
      Right click on :guilabel:`Test Plan` and select :menuselection:`Add --> Config Element --> User Defined Variables`, filling in:
      
      * Name: ``Default HTTP Params``
      
      And adding user defined variables for:
      
      * width: ``400``
      * height: ``400``
      * srs: ``EPSG:4326``
      * extraParameters:
      
      .. figure:: img/jm-request-defaults.png
         
         Request Defaults
      
   
   #. Our test plan is now defined - but we have neglected to record any information during the test. Components that collect information on the tests as they execute are called listeners.
   
      * Right click :guilabel:`Test Plan` and select :menuselection:`Add --> Listener --> View Results Tree`.
      
        This listener gives us easy access to every query made. We can look at the request and response. This listener is useful to check that the tests are working correctly (rather than all quickly returning service exceptions).
      
      * Right click :guilabel:`Test Plan` and select :menuselection:`Add --> Listener --> Generate Summary Results`.
   
      * Right click :guilabel:`Test Plan` and select :menuselection:`Add --> Listener --> Summary Report`.
      
      .. figure:: img/jm-listeners.png
         
         Listeners
   
   #. Now it is time to run our Test Plan and review the result.
      
      Press :guilabel:`Run` (or :kbd:`Control-R`) and review the results.
      
      Make sure you are on the ``View Results Tree`` listener. You should see the requests appear as they occur. Have a look at some of these results, looking at the Request and Response data tabs to ensure that the tests worked correctly. Notice that the requests are for a variety of bounding boxes.
      
      .. figure:: img/jm-results.png
         
         View Results Tree
         
      .. note:: If the results come back as ``service exceptions`` carefully review your configuration and correct before proceeding further.
   
   #. Now it's time to do an actual test. For this we will disable the ``View Results Tree`` as collecting that information affects our tests.
      
      Right click on :guilabel:`View Results Tree` and choose :menuselection:`Disable`.
      
   #. Change to the :guilabel:`Summary Report` to watch the tests execute.
      
      Press :guilabel:`Clear All` and then :guilabel:`Run` to record your first baseline.
      
      .. figure:: img/jm-report.png
         
         Summary Report
         
      Be sure to note down the throughput for vector data, we will be working on improving this number!

   The JMeter tests configured for this workbook are designed to track the achievement of a specific goal. This goal is to quantify the performance benefits of the various tuning and fixes presented in this document and how this improves the capacity of the tuned service to handle requests.
   
   Consider alternate scenarios or your own organizations needs:
   
   * What would the performance goals be for your organization?
   * What settings in the above test plan are you likely to adjust and why?
   * Are the example tests appropriate to your organization? What other tests would you consider?
