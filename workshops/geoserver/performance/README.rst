GeoServer Performance Workshop
==============================

This is an Intermediate workshop and assume familiarity with the GeoServer Administration application.

This workshop is strictly focused on performance and will not covering advanced GeoServer deployment configurations such as clustering.

As presented at FOSS4G Seoul 2015:

> GeoServer is renowned OSGeo application for publishing spatial data. Attend this workshop to benchmark, optimise and tune both GeoServer and your data for the best possible performance.
> Speed is critical to both the users experience and ensuring you get the best value out of your infrastructure investment. While we will talk through the effect of cpu and disk performance this workshop is focused on data preparation, benchmarking and JVM performance considerations.
> While we will talk through the effect of cpu and disk performance this workshop is focused on data preparation, benchmarking and JVM performance considerations. 
> GeoServer performance topics include:
>
> * Establishing a performance baseline and JVM performance tuning
> * GeoServer services performance considerations
> * Rendering performance and style optimisation
> * Generated pre generalized vector data and dynamically changing vector data based on scale
> * Raster performance considerations and GeoTiff optimisation
> * Image format implementations and encoding optimization
> * GeoWebCache and tile map protocols
>
> Some familiarity with GeoServer is expected. Sample data is provided although you are welcome to bring your own and use this workshop to explore your organizationâ€™s optimisation challenges.

As presented at FOSS4G Sydney 2009:

> Making Maps Fast - Performance tuning and Tile Caching
> 
> Speed of response is critical to a user experience. While hardware and platform considerations are briefly discussed, the focus of this workshop is on what can be done at the data level, the service level and especially caching. Participants will see how small changes in design and implementation can reap big benefits.
> 
> The topics of the workshop include: The Data: Spatial data stores. Attribute and spatial indexes. The Map: Limiting what gets rendered. Image size vs. quality. The Cache: Google does it, so can you. The OS: Scalability and concurrency.
> 
> Once we have data loaded into PostGIS and served by GeoServer we will move on to the main focus of the workshop: tile caching. Installing TileCache. Setting up your layer. Configuring GeoWebCache in GeoServer. Metatiling. How it works with HTTP, caching proxies and caching clients.
OpenLayers will be used throughout the workshop to verify the effects of our changes.
