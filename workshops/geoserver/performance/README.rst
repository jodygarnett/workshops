GeoServer Performance Workshop
==============================

As presented at FOSS4G Seoul 2015:

> GeoServer is renowned OSGeo application for publishing spatial data. Attend this workshop to benchmark, optimise and tune both GeoServer and your data for the best possible performance.
> Speed is critical to both the users experience and ensuring you get the best value out of your infrastructure investment. While we will talk through the effect of cpu and disk performance this workshop is focused on data preparation, benchmarking and JVM performance considerations.
> While we will talk through the effect of cpu and disk performance this workshop is focused on data preparation, benchmarking and JVM performance considerations. 
> GeoServer performance topics include:
>
> * Establishing a performance baseline and JVM performance tuning
> * GeoServer services performance considerations
> * Rendering performance and style optimisation
> * Generated pre generalized vector data and dynamically changing vector data based on scale
> * Raster performance considerations and GeoTiff optimisation
> * Image format implementations and encoding optimization
> * GeoWebCache and tile map protocols
>
> Some familiarity with GeoServer is expected. Sample data is provided although you are welcome to bring your own and use this workshop to explore your organizationâ€™s optimisation challenges.

This is an Intermediate workshop and assume familiarity with the GeoServer Administration application.

This workshop is strictly focused on performance and will not covering advanced GeoServer deployment configurations such as clustering.
